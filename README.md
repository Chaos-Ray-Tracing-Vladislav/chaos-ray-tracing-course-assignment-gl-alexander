# ChaosRaytracer

A CPU ray tracer, part of the Chaos Ray Tracing course with added functionalities.

### Base Functionalities

- Support for Diffuse, Reflective and Refractive materials via shaders
- Acceleration structures: [KD Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) for fast intersection checking
- Multithreading: the final image is rendered in buckets of fixed size. Work is split between available threads.
- Textures: bitmap textures, as well as debug textures
- `.crtscene` file format parsing

### Added functionalities

- Path Tracing with explicit light sampling: ray path continues on non-specular hits (global illumination). Rays are "guided" towards a light source.
- Anti=aliasing: [FXAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing) implementation, Rendered AA (option for rays per pixel)
- Animations module: separates mesh-manipulating animations from camera movement (to preserve KD Tree building). Supports orbit animation, as well as [Vertigo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom) 
- Depth of Field: simulates the physical attributes of a real camera (e.g. aperature and focus distance)
- [Stereoscopic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy): simulates the depth and 3D effects of human eyesight by creating two pictures for each eye. The pictures are then combined into a single one using the [anaglyphic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D)
- Bidirectional Path Tracing

### Bidirectional Path Tracing
A fully general light transport algorithm, that can handle a wide variety of cases that a regular Path Tracer misses (especially in tricky lighting conditions). For this "extension" a different approach to materials and ray path construction is used (See [BRDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function))

The algorithm simulates two ray paths for each sample: the camera path (as in the regular path tracer), as well as a light path (that starts at a random light source). These paths are then connected using a variety of techniques, that are then weighed by their importance (Multiple Importance Sampling) and combined, resulting in a higher image quality with fewer ray paths.

This technique allows for [caustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caustic_(optics)) to appear, due to the concentration of light rays in a tight area. These hits are then connected with the camera's lens, which allows us to see them in the final image.
